Welcome to the repository created and maintained by Angelo Ferrando, Andrea Gatti and Viviana Mascardi, that carry/carried out their research on intelligent software agents and multiagent systems the University of Genova, Italy.  
In this repository we collect our work on VEsNA (our core business) and other projects, including those from students of the Multiagent System course, now named Symbolic and Distributed AI.
